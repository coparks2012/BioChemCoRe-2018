Try to solve the problem given by the instructions.txt file in each folder. Some helpful resources might be Google (particularly links to "Stack Overflow" questions), "<command> --help", "man <command>", or even "apropos <keyword>". There can be multiple ways to solve each problem, and it can be helpful when working to know a variety of tools, so be open-minded!

Many questions also have "hint.txt" in case you get stuck and "solution.txt.gz" in case you're really struggling to do it!

Please let me know if there are any problems with these...problems, or feel free to send me more!
