You may or may not want to check out the python glob module to help you get a list of the file names. Try the code:

import glob
files = glob.glob('origFiles/*')
print files[:10] #Just print the first 10, otherwise the output will be obnoxiously long)


If you're having trouble with the leading 0's, google "python leading zeroes". There's an excellent and concise stack overflow post on the subject.

To get the right number of 0's, try a string substitution method:

filename = 'frame%07d.pdb' %(frameNumber)

or try

'100'.zfill(7)
